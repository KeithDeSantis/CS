1)
The ForwardElimination algorithm fails to check if A[i][i] is equal to 0 
before using it as a divisor which in some cases result in a devision by zero 
exception. 





2)
The BetterForwardElimination algorithm divides by the value at A[i][i]. 
However it is possible that this value is equal to 0.
In the explaination of the algorithm it is mentioned that this should be checked for and in the case that A[i][i] does in fact equal 0 then,
"we should take advantage of the first elementary operation
and exchange the ith row with some row below it that has a nonzero coefficient in the ith column".
