# Notes on Scripts

The `searchFileName.ps1` script in this directory was a proof-of-concept challenge done for the independent study with Professor Shue to demonstrate familiarity
and skill with PowerShell scripting, and therefore was purely functional with a few features.

However, I found the the script incredibly useful, so re-engineered it after the course into a python script, `searchByFileName.py`, also found in this repository.
This script is engineered and designed far better, and has been a common side project of mine, as I add new capabilites and design implementations to the search agent.

Feel free to take the script and adjust it as you see fit for your purposes.
