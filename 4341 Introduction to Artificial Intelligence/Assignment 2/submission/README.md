# AI-Assignment-2

This is the submission for Project 2: Genetic Algorithms for CS 4341: Artificial Intelligence in C22 at WPI. \
Our implementation is written in python and was developed using the 3.9 interpreter.\
There are 9 files in this submission:
* README.md (this file)
* ga.py
* geneticalgorithm.py
* numberbins.py
* tower.py
* InputReader.py
* puzzle1.txt
* puzzle2.txt
* Assignment2WriteUp.pdf


Run ```ga.py <puzzle-number> <input-file-path> <seconds-to-run>``` to run the program where <puzzle-number> is 1 or 2, 
<input-file-path> is the path for a file, and <seconds-to-run> is a positive number.\
We have 2 external dependencies on:
* tqdm 
* numpy

Run `pip install tqdm` and `pip install numpy` to get these libraries. The tqdm library allows us to print a progress 
bar on our while loop in the `GeneticAlgorithm` class.\
If you have any trouble running our code, feel free to contact us at wbabincsak@wpi.edu, mplee@wpi.edu, and kwdesantis@wpi.edu.
