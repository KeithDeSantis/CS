# Software Engineering (Java, JavaFX, CSS)

The main focus of this course was the creation of a hospital kiosk application for Brigham and Women's Hospital. Included here is `HospitalApplication.exe`, an executable of the application built for Windows. To bypass the COVID Survey on the opening page of the application, click `Employee Sign In` and enter the `admin` as both username and password.

The source code for this project is in a separate repository found [here](https://github.com/KeithDeSantis/Team-F-Iterations.git).
