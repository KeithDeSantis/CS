## 2011 Machine Organization (B20)
This course taught the basics of the lower level organization of computers and how computation works. Discussed hardware involved in CPUs and how they operate. Learned about how processes are run by a CPU and how different data types were stored on the machine. Projects related to binary exploitation and memory manipulation.
* C
* Assembly
* Bash
## 2102 Object-Oriented Programming (D20)
An introduction to Java and the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm. Projects related to systems programming using objects, inheritance, and design strategies.
* Java
## 2223 Algorithms (B20)
Exploration of important algorithms and algorithmic development used in computing. Projects related to graph search algorithms, search engine algorithms, and plaintext processing
* Java
## 2303 Systems Programming Concepts (A20)
An introduction to Systems programming and the C and C++ languages. Projects related to memory manipulation and management.
* C
* C ++
## 3013 Operating Systems (C21)
This course taught the design principles and mechanisms of operating systems. Topics included memory management, process management and virtual memory, threads and threading, file system design, and processing policies.
* C
## 3043 Social Implications of Information Processing (B20)
Social science course that discussed impact of computational sciences and programmed systems on society and individuals. Focused on class discussions, case study research, and paper writing to explore the responsibilities of being a programmer in the modern world.
## 3133 Foundations of Computer Science (A21)
Theoretical logic course that explained the mathematical and logical basis of computing. Topics taught included Finite Automata, Regular Expressions, Languages and Language Parsing, and Computational Theory.
## 3733 Software Engineering (D21)
A course built around working in a team of 11 to develop a Java application for a Kiosk in Brigham and Women's Hospital. The process of software development was taught using common design patterns, the SCRUM methodology, and week-long development "sprints."
* Java
* JavaFX
* CSS
## 4341 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (C22)
An introduction to the concepts of artificial intelligence and their use cases. Lessons covered hill climbing, graph searching, neural networks, reinforcement learning, machine learning, genetic algorithms, and more. The projects were built around A*, Genetic Algorithms, Machine Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.
* Java
* Python
## 4401 Software Security Enginerring (D22)
This course was structured as a "Capture the Flag Challenge" event, where challenges related to security were released and students acted as the "attacker" to exploit files or websites and retrieve a flag.txt file to submit for points. Topics covered included Binary Exploitation, Web Exploitation, Game Exploitation, and others.
* Python
* C
* Assembly
* Bash
## 4404 Tools and Techniques in Network Security (B22)
This class explored common attack vectors and their related countermeasures in the field of network security. Topics varied class to class and were based around research papers in related fields. Some topics covered include SSL and TLS, OCSP, DNSSec, IPSec, BGP Spoofing, Multi-Factor Authentication, Botnets, Browser Fingerprinting, and more.
* Python
* OpenFlow Protocol (Ryu)
* MySQL
## 4516 Advanced Computer Networks (D22)
This course centered around recent innovations and problems facing the field of computer networking. Included an iterative term project where we developed a Software Defined Network using the OpenFlow protocol to enforce dynamic DNS assignment and enforce honey-potting security measures on a web server architecture.
* Python
* OpenFlow Protocol (Ryu)
## 4999 Independent Study with Craig Shue (A21)
An independent study where I researched multiple topics including but not limited to DLL's and DLL injection, powershell scripting, and Microsoft Detours, eventually doing some work adjacent to [Professor Shue's research](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~cshue/projects/).
* C
* C ++
* C #
* PowerShell
* Bash
