Re-designing shopping cart:
	1) more shelves in the cart
	2) scale
	3) Item scanner built in on cart
	4) self checkout system on cart
	5) auto wheel locking if customer tries to leave without paying
	6) modular shelving system
	7) cart tracking system for data analysis
	8) assistence button
	9) map of store layout
	10) phone/list holder

Combine and evolve ideas:
	-Ideas 1 and 6 are very similar
	-Ideas 3,4,and 9 all fall under the idea of added a screen and technology to the cart
	-Idea 5 would go with idea 7 for theft avoidence

Proritize Ideas:
	1) self checkout system (further investigastion needed to determine level of achivability)
	2) auto wheel locking 
	3) assistence button
	4) map of store (screen)
	
Critique:
	1) I think I may have had some silly ideas initially but in the end I think they ended up being ok.
	2) I think I was able to jump around and get a wide range of ideas
	
IDEO Shopping Cart:
	1) I found it suprizing when they said that they are not experts in anything but rather the know the design 
	process and therefor they can do anything.
	2) I say that they sketched ideas and worked in groups
	3) They built prototypes to figure out wht works well and what doesn't.
	4) They reached out to the people their idea would effect and got their input.
