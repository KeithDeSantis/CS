# Tools and Techniques in Network Security (Python - MySQL - OpenFlow)

This repository contains files related to the three Mission Projects for CS4404: Tools and Techniques in Network Security at\
WPI in B term of 2022.

This class focused on learning about Network Security and common attack vectors and their related countermeasures. Topics varied class to class and were based around research papers in related fields. Some topics covered include SSL and TLS, OCSP, DNSSec, IPSec, BGP Spoofing, Multi-Factor Authentication, Botnets, Browser Fingerprinting, and more.

Three projects (called "Missions") were conducted throughout the term. Each mission was themed around a network security topic and was comprised of a Reconnaisance Phase, Attack Phase, and Defense Phase. In the Reconnaisance Phase we researched the topic and common attack vectors and countermeasures. We then implemented a related attack on an isolated network for the Attack Phase. Finally we defended against our attack with a defense based on real world practices for the Defense Phase. Each Mission folder has directories containing the home directories of each VM on the isolated network, a Mission description PDF, a Mission Writeup Report PDF, and any other related files.

The three project topics were:

* `Mission 1` - Web Infrastructure Security
* `Mission 2` - Multi-Factor Authentication
* `Mission 3` - Intrusion Detection Systems and Botnets
