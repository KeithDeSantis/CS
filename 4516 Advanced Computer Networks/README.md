# Advanced Computer Networks Project

This repository contains files related to Team 17's term project for CS4516: Advanced Computer Networks at\
WPI in D term of 2022.

Our project involved creating and simulating an SDN network, using 4 VMs in an isolated network and analyzing performance. The network contained a client, DNS server, OpenFlow controller, and web server. The project simulated NAT while also adding additional security benefits including virtual IP allocation, verification, and possible HoneyPot functionality. OpenVSwitch was used to simulate an OpenFlow switch and the Ryu controller API was used to create an OpenFlow controller.

The project description is included at `resources.pdf`

For sake of future projects in the course, many files and code have been omitted from this public repository, including but not limited to our OpenFlow controller scripts.

If you have interest in seeing the omitted course materials feel free to contact me at `kwdesantis@wpi.edu` or `keithwdesantis@gmail.com`.
