I can over flow the content that EBP points to while it the function is in auth()

But I can't reach the return address that is stored directly after that because of the limit hardcoded
on decode length (<13) that must be met to call auth()

Need 12 bytes to overflow what EBP points to CAN DO THIS

Need 16 bytes to overflow the return address WANT THIS

12 byte decode_length ~= 16 byte original_input
16 byte decode length ~= 20ish byte original input (i forget)


As far as I can tell I can't use the content that EBP points to for anything,
since any arithmetic is done with EBP's pointer address, not the content it points to.

When leave is called it moves ESP to point at the same place as EBP, then pops EBP, making EBP the content
of what it was pointing to before, and ESP pointing to the chunk of memory that was just above EBP (in this case the return address
that I can't access)
