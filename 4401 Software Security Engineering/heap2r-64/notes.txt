Maybe fill in zoomcall as if it is an auth struct, such that there is filler and then auth->auth is 1.

Then, in auth, input the address of zoomcall, because I believe it is trying to read it as an address, so it will get the string at zoomcall's address

(which will overwrite auth)

THIS ISNT RIGHT^


-----------------------------------------------

When the line read in for auth is 48 long it turns auth->auth to 10. Adding another character jumps it to 2657

Maybe overwrite auth* with zoomcall such that it points the the right distance before zoomcall such that the 1 i put in zoomcall is auth->auth.

Doesnt seem right tho
