We can use the buffer to overflow all the way up to the return address 0x8 bytes above with to a code pointer that points to

Place in ur buffer:

bytes for call win


And override the return code address with the address of that above^



the beginning of the win instruction is at offset 0x7aa,

but from where? Need to run gdb to figure that out I think

It is at address 0x5555555547aa on the server


Buffer size is 103 or 104 I believe

So should fill the buffer then input the little endian version of 0x5555555547aa

"\xaa\x47\x55\x55\x55\x55\x00\x00" I think (might need to add \x00\x00 at the end to make the address a full 64 bits?? 0x00005555555547aa)
