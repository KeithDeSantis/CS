We need to overflow on the heap.

Run to see where the data and fp are on the heap  (in terms of hex addresses)

structs may add some extra length to the memory taken up by data or fp

There is also meta data with each variable.

You want fp to be after data (higher address than data)


Your input is the first arg to main


Find out where winner is saved and out that in fp
