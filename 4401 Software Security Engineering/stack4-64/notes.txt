Buff Size on My machine seems to be 72.

It checks that the ret value is in the stack somewhere.

So we need to inject to OUR CODE which we have written into the stack.

We want to inject shellcode so the program will launch a shell, then rewrite the return address to the address of the shellcode.

Need to write assembly to Set up arguments in proper registers and call the syscall, all to pop a shell.

(Just get the shell code from online)



Shell code I have is being weird. It seems to get to the syscall, but is saying "Illegal Instruction" when 
it runs. Tried different things to keep it from closing but still busted. The shellcode I have doesn't set
RSI or RDX with a second or third arg (just 0x0), could that be involved? It was also one of the only
shellcodes I could find that seemed decent and to work.

Gonna have to ask on discord or office hours.

On server the return address of stack4-64 is 0x7fffffffe418 (rbp 8 below that)
