Understand the idea of how to overflow and use shellcode injection with nop-sledding, but the ret of main is weird,
it's doing some strange stuff with ecx and popping a bunch and isn't working the way I thought it would, need to ask
later or see if they talk about it in class.


Server info:

GDB ebp: 0xffffd548

Return address guess: 0xffffd644

return address: 0xffffde05


This one had some fuckery with ecx, such that ecx needed to be an address to a spot that contained an address to our nop sled.

So, I used a sled of my nop sled guess address, and had ecx contain a guess to get to that sled. The guess had to be a multiple of 4 so it would land on the beginning of the address in my sled. Then that address guess would land in the nop sled and execute my shell code!
