# Software Security Engineering

This repository contains files related to challenges in the CS 4401 Software Security Engineering course.

This course was structured as a "Capture the Flag Challenge" event, where challenges related to security were released and students acted as the "attacker" to exploit files or websites and retrieve a `flag.txt` file to submit for points. Topics covered included Binary Exploitation, Web Exploitation, Game Exploitation, and others.

For sake of future projects in the course, many files and code have been omitted from this public repository, including but not limited to `flag.txt` files, `solution.txt` files, and Python `exploit.py` scripts used to solve the challenges.

If you have interest in seeing the omitted course materials feel free to contact me at `kwdesantis@wpi.edu` or `keithwdesantis@gmail.com`.
